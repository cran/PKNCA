\title{Determine which concentrations were used for half-life calculation}
\usage{
get_halflife_points(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A PKNCAresults object}
}
\value{
A logical vector with \code{TRUE} if the point was used for half-life
(including concentrations below the limit of quantification within the
range of times for calculation), \code{FALSE} if it was not used for half-life
but the half-life was calculated for the interval, and \code{NA} if half-life
was not calculated for the interval. If a row is excluded from all
calculations, it is set to \code{NA} as well.
