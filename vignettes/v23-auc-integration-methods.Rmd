# Integration methods for Area Under the Concentration-Time curve (AUC)

There are `r length(auc_methods)` methods for choosing how to integrate the AUC
between two concentration measurements in `PKNCA`.  They are
`r comma_and(auc_methods)`.  Additionally, there are `r length(auc_types)`
methods for extrapolating after the last concentration above the limit of
quantification.  They are `r comma_and(auc_types)`.  Other methods of
calculating AUC (such as AUC~tau~ and AUC~int~) are made with variants of these.

# Definitions and abbreviations

* AUC: Area under the concentration-time curve
* BLQ: Below the lower limit of quantification
* LLOQ: lower limit of quantification
* NCA: Noncompartmental analysis
* Profile: A set of concentration-time points for calculation
* T~last~: The last concentration above the limit of quantification within a profile
* T~max~: The time of the maximum concentration

# Description of methods of integrating between two concentrations before T~last~

Note that other NCA tools may not describe interpolation as zero.  The
zero-interpolation rules are used by PKNCA to assist with other methods used
across the suite of tools for interpolation and data cleaning within PKNCA.  The
zero-interpolation rules could be swapped for linear trapezoidal rules with the
same effects here.

## Linear up/logarithmic down (`"lin up/log down"`) interpolation

Linear up/logarithmic down interpolation is the most commonly used method for
PK, and it is the default for `PKNCA`.

Linear up/logarithmic down interpolation is often used when an exogenous
substance is dosed and measured, and when the elimination likely occurs by
first-order elimination from the body.

Linear up/logarithmic down interpolation uses the following rules in order for
each pair of concentrations through T~last~:

1. If concentrations are both zero, interpolate as zero;
2. If concentrations are decreasing and the second concentration is not zero,
   use logarithmic interpolation; and
3. If concentrations are decreasing before T~last~ or increasing ever, use
   linear interpolation.

## Linear trapezoidal (`"linear"`) interpolation

Linear trapezoidal interpolation is often used when an endogenous substance is
measured (and possibly dosed), and when the elimination may not occur by
first-order elimination processes.

Linear trapezoidal interpolation uses the following rules in order for each pair
of concentrations through T~last~:

1. If concentrations are both zero, interpolate as zero; and
2. Use linear interpolation for all other times (this could be the only rule).

## Linear to T~max~/logarithmic after T~max~ (`"lin-log"`) interpolation

Linear to T~max~/logarithmic after T~max~ interpolation is infrequently used.
It uses the following rules in order for each pair of concentrations through
T~last~:

1. If concentrations are both zero, interpolate as zero;
2. If concentrations are before T~max~, use linear interpolation;
3. If concentrations are after T~max~ (and before T~last~) and either concentration is zero, use linear interpolation; and
4. If concentrations are after T~max~ and neither is zero, use logarithmic interpolation.

# Description of methods of integrating between two concentrations after T~last~

## `"AUClast"` extrapolation

AUClast extrapolation after T~last~ is the simplest.  It is no extrapolation;
the extrapolated AUC integral is zero.

## `"AUCall"` extrapolation

AUCall extrapolation after T~last~ has two rules:

1. If the last concentration measured is above the limit of quantification (in
   other words, the last time is T~last~), then no extrapolation is done; otherwise
2. Integrate linearly the triangle between T~last~ and the time of zero
   concentration after T~last~.

## `"AUCinf"` extrapolation

AUCinf extrapolation requires estimation of a half-life.  It extrapolates using the equation

$Extrap = \frac{C_{last}}{\lambda_z}$
