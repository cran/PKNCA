\usage{
PKNCA_impute_method_start_conc0(conc, time, start = 0, ..., options = list())

PKNCA_impute_method_start_cmin(conc, time, start, end, ..., options = list())

  conc,
  time,
  start,
  end,
  ...,
  max_shift = NA_real_,
  options = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conc}{Concentration measured}

\item{time}{Time of concentration measurement (must be monotonically
increasing and the same length as the concentration data)}

\item{start, end}{The start and end of the interval}

\item{...}{ignored}

\item{options}{List of changes to the default \code{\link{PKNCA.options}} for
calculations.}

\item{max_shift}{The maximum amount of time to shift a concentration forward
(defaults to 5\% of the interval duration, i.e. \code{0.05*(end - start)})}
}
\value{
A data.frame with one column named conc with imputed concentrations
  and one column named time with the times.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{PKNCA_impute_method_start_conc0()}: Add a new concentration of 0 at the start
time, even if a nonzero concentration exists at that time (usually used
with single-dose data)

\item \code{PKNCA_impute_method_start_cmin()}: Add a new concentration of the minimum during
the interval at the start time (usually used with multiple-dose data)

\item \code{PKNCA_impute_method_start_predose()}: Shift a predose concentration to become the
time zero concentration (only if a time zero concentration does not exist)

}}
