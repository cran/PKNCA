\title{Run any function with a maximum missing fraction of X and 0s possibly
counting as missing.  The maximum fraction missing comes from
\code{PKNCA.options("max.missing")}.}
\usage{
pk.business(FUN, zero.missing = FALSE, max.missing)
}
\arguments{
\item{FUN}{function to run.  The function is called as \code{FUN(x, ...)}
with missing values removed.}

\item{zero.missing}{Are zeros counted as missing?  If \code{TRUE} then
include them in the missing count.}

\item{max.missing}{The maximum fraction of the data allowed to be missing (a
number between 0 and 1, inclusive).}
}
\value{
A version of FUN that can be called with parameters that are checked
  for missingness (and zeros) with missing (and zeros) removed before the
  call.  If \code{max.missing} is exceeded, then NA is returned.
}
\description{
Note that all missing values are removed prior to calling the function.
}
\examples{
my_mean <- pk.business(FUN=mean)
mean(c(1:3, NA))
# Less than half missing results in the summary statistic of the available
# values.
my_mean(c(1:3, NA))
# More than half missing results in a missing value
my_mean(c(1:3, rep(NA, 4)))
}
