\title{Count the number of concentration measurements in an interval}
\usage{
pk.calc.count_conc(conc, check = TRUE)

pk.calc.count_conc_measured(conc, check = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{conc}{Measured concentrations}

\item{check}{Run \code{\link[=assert_conc]{assert_conc()}}?}
}
\value{
a count of the non-missing concentrations (0 if all concentrations
are missing)

a count of the non-missing, measured (not below or above the limit
of quantification) concentrations (0 if all concentrations are missing)
}
\description{
\code{count_conc} and \code{count_conc_measured} are typically used for quality control
on the data to ensure that there are a sufficient number of non-missing
samples for a calculation and to ensure that data are consistent between
individuals.
